Copy whoopee.ino to your Spark login

Copy whoopee.html to your computer and enter both the access_token and CoreID from the spark.io site

Note: The CoreID is private so whoopee.html should never go on the internet. If you want to use a better solution go to the github site:

From your computer click the fart button and you should see the iFrame reutrn "1" if it could work.
